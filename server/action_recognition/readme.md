### Action-Recognition


This repository contains the code for detecting human-actions based on the images sent from object-detection module. This is built on top of [Video Classification 3d CNN](https://github.com/kenshohara/video-classification-3d-cnn-pytorch). 

As a sub-module in the frame prediction project, the functionality of this module is to detect actions. It is limited to human actions for now.
